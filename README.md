# ModLR
ModLR is a SPSS macro to analyse moderated regression model that includes a number of covariates, a predictor and moderator variable. The program is written in spd extension format, which can be installed via custom dialog in SPSS. 
ModLR is capable of performing a moderated regression analysis with a categorical moderator (0, 1 dummy) in which case the lower and upper boundaries of the Johnson-Neyman region of insignificance will be reported. It can also be used to analyze 2x2 ANOVA between-subject design with covariates provided that the categorical variables are coded as 0 and 1.
If you click 'Option', ModLR contains the multimodel inference approach for checking potential spurious moderation.
